All rights reserved.</p>\n        <p>One could determine which documents are relevant to a query just by comparing the terms in the query to those \n            in the documents. This is how search engines used to work. Then in the 1990s, Google was founded using a different \n            approach based on the PageRank algorithm (designed by the founders). The algorithm ranks pages based on the links \n            among them (without considering the content), with pages that get linked to by other pages (more “authoritative” \n            pages) getting priority in the results. Here are the key principles underlying the design of PageRank:</p> <br/>\n        <li>The more pages that link to a page j, the more authoritative j should be. For example, if “Blog Brown” is linked \n            to by 5 web pages, and the Wikipedia article on “Providence, Rhode Island” is linked to by 500 pages, then it makes \n            sense to consider the Wikipedia article more authoritative.</li><br/>\n        <li>The more authoritative those pages are, the still more authoritative j should be. Now, if “Providence Place Mall” \n            is linked to only by “Providence, Rhode Island”, and “Blueno” is linked to only by “Blog Brown,” it might not be \n            enough to measure a page’s authority simply by a count of the number of pages that link to that page. Indeed, it \n            makes sense to consider “Providence Place Mall” more authoritative than “Blueno” since it is linked to by a more \n            important page.</li> <br/>\n        <li>The fewer links those pages have to pages other than j, the more authoritative j should be. Assume “Research at \n            Brown” is linked to only by a “NYTimes” article which links to only 10 other pages, while “Why Brown?” is linked \n            to only by “Blog Brown”, which links to 200 other pages. Because the \"NYTimes’’ page has only a few links, and \n            “Brown Blog” has many links, a link from the “NYTimes” page can be considered to be more important than a link \n            from the “Brown Blog”, leading us to attribute more authority to “Research at Brown” than “Why Brown?”</li> <br/>\n        <li>The closer j is to another page k (measured by the number of links that must be followed to get from j to k), \n            the more k’s score should influence j’s. For example, if the average path from “Brown University” to “Boeing” is \n            100 links, and the average path from “Brown University” to “Amy’s Personal Website” is 5 links, then all other \n            things equal, Amy’s page should be considered more authoritative than Boeing’s.</li>\n        <ProjHeader text=\"PageRank uses these principles to compute the authority of each document. The algorithm works \n        roughly as follows: Each page’s authority is a number between 0 and 1, where the total authority across all documents \n        always equals 1. The algorithm starts by assuming that all documents have the same authority. Then, following the \n        principles, the algorithm updates the authorities based on the links between pages. Since the authority of one page \n        can affect that of another, this process of refining authorities repeats until the authorities stabilize across all \n        documents (the underlying mathematics guarantee eventual stabilization). It is important that the total authority in \n        the system is conserved, so at any point in the converging sequence of page ranks, the total authority in the system \n        will always sum to 1.\" />\n        <br/>\n        <ProjHeader title=\"due to the collaboration policy...\" text=\"I cannot say much more about this project.
