All you need now is an internet connection to access a wide \n                    range of entertainment and tools. Ozone is a startup that promises to fill the void of a fast, online video editor. Their idea has\n                    a huge potential. </p>\n            </div>\n            <br/> \n            <br/>\n            <div class=\"designChoices\">\n                <div>\n                    <img class=\"image\" src={lockscreen} alt=\"lock screen from figma\"/>\n                    <br/>\n                    <img class=\"image\" src={chatscreen} alt=\"chat screen from figma\"/>\n                </div>\n                <div class=\"designChoicesText\">\n                    <ProjHeader title=\"design choices\"/>\n                    <br/>\n                    <p class=\"para\" >Because this is a collaborative video editing software, we needed to think about special features to include in our design.\n                        We decided to include a share button, similar to many Google products. It was also challenging to think about how \n                        collaborative video editing would actually work. One idea we came up with was the concept of a “lock.” Essentially, \n                        if a user locks a video or audio file, it prevents other users from editing it at the same time. This helps eliminate \n                        potential issues with contiguous editing. This would hopefully make the workflow smoother, since each user wouldn’t have \n                        to constantly refresh the project after any edit is made.</p>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <div class=\"designChoices\">\n                <div class=\"designChoicesText\">\n                    <ProjHeader title=\"user testing\" text=\"Using UserTesting.com, we had real people use our interface to give us feedback\n                        and suggestions.

Making a prototype, getting feedback, then\n                implementing that feedback in multiple rounds showed me that the best designs come from the combination of different sets of visions, and\n                a lot of iterations.
